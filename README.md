## Project Overview

White Knight is a browser extension designed to combat hate speech in online communities by detecting and highlighting hateful comments, and providing users with counter speech options. Our goal is to promote positive and respectful interactions online, making the internet a safer and more welcoming place.

This project was developed as part of the AAI Project Semester at FHSTP BCC, involving a team of seven members from the AI Media Lab for the Bachelor of Creative Computing.

## Features

- **Hate Speech Detection**: Scans comments on YouTube videos and highlights hate speech.
- **Counter Speech Generation**: Provides generated counter speech responses for detected hate speech comments.
- **Regenerate Counter Speech**: Allows users to regenerate counter speech responses if they are not satisfied with the initial suggestions.
- **Reply with Counter Speech**: Users can either copy the counter speech or directly insert it into the reply field.
